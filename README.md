This repository contains all Mathematica notebooks and computation scripts used in the proofs of **Theorems 3.1** and **3.2** of the paper *“Quadratic systems with two invariant real straight lines and an invariant parabola.”*

The scripts are organized following the logical and textual order of the paper, so that each computation corresponds directly to a specific step in the proofs.  
Each notebook includes symbolic derivations, simplifications, and parameter normalizations that were used to verify the classification results.

### Contents
- `/Theorem3_1/` — computations supporting Theorem 3.1  
- `/Theorem3_2/` — computations supporting Theorem 3.2  

### How to use
Open the notebooks in Mathematica 13.0 or later.  
All symbolic computations can be evaluated sequentially. The comments in each cell indicate the corresponding part of the paper.

### Citation
If you use or adapt these computations, please cite the corresponding paper:

> Jaume Llibre and Huaxin Ou, *Quadratic systems with two invariant real straight lines and an invariant parabola*, [2025].
